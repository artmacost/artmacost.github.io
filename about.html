<center><p> I am an art student at San Jose State University. I have been making art since childhood, but took my first art class at age eleven. I continued to make art throughout middle and high school and decided to pursue it as a career when I reached college. My current goal is to become a teacher and inspire young people to become artists, just as my teachers did for me. 

<br/>

<p>

Today, I enjoy creating vivid, colorful drawings and paintings. Most of my work is inspired by the natural world, specifically flowers. I have been using colored pencils since 2014, but recently have dabbled in other mediums, such as watercolor and oil. </p>
